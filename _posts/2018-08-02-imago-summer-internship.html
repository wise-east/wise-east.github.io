    I've had a great opportunity to work as an artificial intelligence researcher at Imago.ai for the summer of 2018. I worked on building a question and answering that could be used to automatically answer customer's questions. Our team used a BiDAF model augmented with self-attention capacities, trained with the SQuAD and MSMARCO datasets. The full demo of our work can be found <a href="http://bidaf.imago.ai/" target="_blank" > here.</a>
