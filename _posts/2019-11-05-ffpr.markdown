As a quick, fun side project, I trained a GPT-2 model to automatically generate fast food press releases. It was inspired by a podcast called My Brother & My Brother & Me, in which the hosts made fun of a food press release by Pizza Hut, claiming that it wasn't written by humans but by AI. This is not state-of-the-art (I couldn't train the largest GPT-2 model that's avialable), but it should come close to it. The model was based off of the implementation by HuggingFace's [Transformers package](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html){:target="_blank"}, and it was trained with food-related news scraped from multiple websites, such as [chewboom.com](https://chewboom.com){:target="_blank"}. 

The site is not scalable and it may take a while to get your article as it is currently hosted on a machine with only CPU support. A demo can be found [here](http://ffpr.isi.edu){:target="_blank"}.
