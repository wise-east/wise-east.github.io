I've had a great opportunity to work as an artificial intelligence researher at Imago.ai for the summer of 2018. I worked on a natural language processing task, specifically machine comprehension and question and answering. Our team used a BiDAF model augmented with self-attention capacities, trained with the SQuAD and MSMARCO datasets. A demo of my work can be found <a href="http://bidaf.imago.ai/" target="_blank" > here.</a>
