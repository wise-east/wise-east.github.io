Joshua Tree National Park is one of my favorite national parks in California, not only for its relative accessibility from Los Angeles but also because of its unique landscape that I haven't seen anywhere else. 


Located between the Mojave Desert the Colorado Desert, its vegetation is impressive and diverse. If you were like me and haven't seen a Joshua Tree (Yucca brevifolia) before, for which the park is named after (in case it wasn't too obvious), you'll be amazed by their interesting appearance. It seems like someone genetically modified a tree to look like a cactus!  

This is my go-to place when I have family and friends visit me. I fell in love with this place since the first time I visited back in the winter of 2018. Since then, I've been here four times already! Each time the park had something new to offer, as different types of plants become more prevalent depending on the season. I suggest going here on a cloud-free sky if you are looking forward to star-gazing at night (see first photo). Make sure to take a lot of warm clothing with you because it gets really cold and windy at night, even during the summer! Otherwise, I'd suggest a weather with some cloud for cooler weather, which will help you get around during the day. Also having some clouds makes the sunset at JT even more sublime. With a nice backdrop of clouds, it seems as if the sky has been set on fire! 


I've attached some of my favorite photos that I've taken during my visits. I used a Sony A6000 camera with a Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens. I hope you visit JT some time soon and fall in love with the place and enjoy it as much I have!
