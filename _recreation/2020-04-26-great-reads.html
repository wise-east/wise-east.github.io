    Below is a list of books, blog posts and entire blogs that I have read that I believe are worth sharing. They are very coursely grouped into categories for guidance. I share it here hoping it is of interest to some people.

    I sincerely welcome constructive criticism about this list. Another reason that I make this public is in the hope that you expose my naivet√©, explaining why an item on this list should not be here or why it should be taken with a grain of salt. It will let me consider different perspectives and learn new things that I could not conceive on my own, and I enjoy this process. I look forward to your recommendations and feedback! This post will continue to grow with irregular updates.
