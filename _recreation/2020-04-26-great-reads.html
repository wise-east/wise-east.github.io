    Below is a list of resources, including books, individual blog posts and entire blogs that I have read and believe are worth sharing. I share it here in case anyone is interested. They are grouped into broad categories to make it easier for you to find what you are interested in. The specific ordering of the resources in each category bears no meaning.

<div>
    I sincerely welcome constructive criticism about this list. The main reason that I make this public is in the hopes that anyone who finds it can expose my naivet√©, explaining why an item on this list should not be here or why it should be taken with a grain of salt. Help me broaden my perspectives and learn new things that I could not conceive on my own - I absolutely enjoy this process! I look forward to your recommendations and feedback. This post will continue to grow with irregular updates.

        Sebastian Ruder's <a target="_blank" href="https://ruder.io">website</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://newsletter.ruder.io/">newsletter</a>

            <li>I enjoy reading Sebastian's newsletter as a starting point for getting myself updated with a nice variety of areas in NLP. He also wrote many useful blog posts with advice on doing research.</li>

                Excellent visualizations for understanding concepts relevant to modern NLP, from NumPy to the inner workings of Transformers.

        Paul Graham's <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/">website</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Best known as the founder of Y Combinator, Paul Graham has many interesting essays on his website, which now gets more than 15 million page views every year. I especially enjoyed his piece on <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/genius.html" >The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/useful.html">How to Write Usefully</a>.</li>

        Tim Dettmers on <a target="_blank" href="https://timdettmers.com/2020/03/10/how-to-pick-your-grad-school/">How to Pick Your Grad School </a>
        <ul>
            <li>A comprehensive post on factors to consider when picking a graduate program. While some factor may be more important for someone interested in research in computer science, most of his explanation is general enough to be applicable to any area of study.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>This was my gateway into thinking more seriously about my personal finance. His analogy of every dollar being workers that are working hard to make money for you caused a major shift in how I think about money and how I should spend it. Understanding assets versus liabilities was equally significant.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>The first book that piqued my interest about human history. It challenged many things that perceived as the "norm" and painted the bigger picture about humanity and our place in this world.</li>
