<div>
    Below is a list of resources, including books, individual blog posts and entire blogs that I have read and believe are worth sharing. They are grouped into broad categories to make it easier for you to find what you are interested in. I share it here in case anyone is interested.

<div>
    I sincerely welcome constructive criticism about this list. The main reason that I make this public is in the hopes that anyone who finds it can expose my naivet√©, explaining why an item on this list should not be here or why it should be taken with a grain of salt. Help me broaden my perspectives and learn new things that I could not conceive on my own - I absolutely enjoy this process! I look forward to your recommendations and feedback. This post will continue to grow with irregular updates.
