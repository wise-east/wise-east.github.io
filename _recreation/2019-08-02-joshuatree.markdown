Joshua Tree National Park is one of my favorite national parks in California, not only for its relative accessibility from Los Angeles but also its unique landscape that I haven't seen anywhere else. While it is in between the Mojave Desert the Colorado Desert, it has some impressive vegetation. If you were like me and haven't seen a Joshua Tree (Yucca brevifolia) before, for which the park is named after (in case it wasn't too obvious), you'll be amazed by their interesting appearance, seemingly having genetically modified a tree with a cactus-look. 

This is my go-to place when I have family and friends come visit me, since I fell in love with this place since the first time I visited back in the winter of 2018. Since then, I've been here four times already! Each time had something differnet to offer, as the vegetation that is most prevalent is slightly different depending on the season. I suggest going here on a cloud-free sky if you are looking forward to star-gazing at night (see first photo). Otherwise, I'd suggest a weather with some cloud just to make the weather a bit cooler, and also having some clouds make the sunset at JT even more sublime. With a nice backdrop of clouds, it can look as if the sky is on fire! (see second photo)


I've attached some photos I've taken during my visits. I used a Sony A6000 camera with a Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens. I hope you visit JT some time soon and fall in love with the place as much I have!
