				<h3> üëã Hi there!	</h3>

				<div class="intro-text">
					I am a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California's (USC) Information Sciences Institute (ISI), advised by <a href="https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/" target="_blank"> Jonathan May</a>. 
					Previously, I was a programmer analyst at ISI and did my undergraduate studies at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) with a major in Computer Science, where I first worked on NLP with <a href="https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/" target="_blank">Pascale Fung</a>. I've interned at Meta in 2021 and 2022 and at Amazon AGI in 2023 and 2024.  
				</div>

				<div class="intro-text">
					My research focuses on building <strong>human-centric AI</strong> systems that effectively collaborate with us by interactively understanding and fulfilling our intended goals, which are often communicated unclearly or without necessary context. I am interested in creating virtual environments with user models and task-specific user interfaces to simulate noisy human-AI interactions of complex real-world challenges. With high-fidelity simulations, I explore generating high-quality synthetic data at scale and designing novel reward functions for reinforcement learning and rejection sampling to post-train models. A central theme of my work is  <em>human-AI context synchronization</em>, expanding the scope of context shared by humans and AI about each other's knowledge, goals, and capabilities to balance AI utility with human agency and privacy.

				<h3> üìÜ Office hours</h3>
				<div>
					I host virtual office hours! I've had the pleasure making many new connections through these office hours. I'm open to discussing anything from research to career advice that I can help with.
